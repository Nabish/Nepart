            <p><b>Chamba Rumaal</b> is one of the rarest Craft forms that use SATIN stitch, the uniqueness of this stitching is that it creates exact motif on both sides of the fabric, and it is impossible to determine the right side of the fabric if the selvedge is not considered. This Craft has championed its innovative techniques to reversible garments as it is the only embroidery form in the world that looks mirrored from both side and exactly same. Today it is practised by handful in the valleys of Chamba, a region in Himachal Pradesh.</p>

            <p>This three dimensional art is as old as civilization, be it Indus Valley, Rome, Greece or any world culture, the only form is sculpture that unveils and reflects how the civilization was. Sculpture is one of greatest activities of any Art, Culture & Country for thousands of years. It is also very tactile and great stress buster, that brings the 3-D translation of your ideas and imagination. The 2-day workshop is focused on how to make magnificent sculptures with various mediums of including clay, plaster of Paris, wax as main materials. This workshop aims to bring three dimensional forms out of 2-D concepts and mere imagination OR drawings.</p>
